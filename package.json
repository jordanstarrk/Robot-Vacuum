  "description": "A console application that navigates a imaginary robotic hoover through an imaginary room based on: - room dimensions as X and Y coordinates, identifying the top right corner of the room rectangle. This room is divided up in a grid based on these dimensions; a room that has dimensions X: 5 and Y: 5 has 5 columns and 5 rows, so 25 possible hoover positions. The bottom left corner is the point of origin for our coordinate system, so as the room contains all coordinates its bottom left corner is defined by X: 0 and Y: 0 - locations of patches of dust, also defined by X and Y coordinates identifying the bottom left corner of those grid positions - an initial hoover position (X and Y coordinates like patches of dust) - driving instructions (as cardinal directions where e.g. N and E mean \"go north\" and \"go east\" respectively)",
